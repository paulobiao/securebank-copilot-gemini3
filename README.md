# SecureBank Copilot (Gemini 3)

SecureBank Copilot is an AI-native application built from scratch during the Google Gemini 3 Hackathon (Dec 2025 – Feb 2026).

The application uses Gemini 3 as its core reasoning engine to transform raw cybersecurity incidents into executive-ready decisions, risk summaries, and control mappings.

Although inspired by general industry practices in cybersecurity governance, no source code, artifacts, or implementations were reused from prior projects.

## Built With
- Google Gemini 3 API
- Gemini reasoning and long-context capabilities
- Lightweight web interface for public demo

## Gemini Integration
Gemini 3 is central to the application and is responsible for:
- Contextual incident reasoning
- Mapping incidents to security controls
- Generating board-level summaries and recommendations
- Explaining decisions transparently

Without Gemini 3, the application does not function.
