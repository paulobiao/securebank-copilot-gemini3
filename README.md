# SecureBank Copilot — Gemini 3 Hackathon Submission

SecureBank Copilot is a Google AI Studio application powered by Gemini 3 that transforms raw cybersecurity incident descriptions into board-ready decision artifacts for financial institutions.

## Overview
Given a security incident description, the app generates:
- An Executive Briefing focused on business impact and decisions
- A Technical Triage plan (P0, P1, P2 actions)
- A Control Mapping Report across key security domains
- A structured Risk Register entry with likelihood and impact

The goal is to bridge the gap between technical incident response and executive decision-making under time pressure.

## Built With
- Google AI Studio
- Gemini 3
- Prompt-based structured generation

## Gemini 3 Usage
Gemini 3 is used to analyze incident context, generate structured outputs, and maintain consistent reasoning across executive, technical, and risk-focused sections.

## Eligibility and Timing
This submission was prepared specifically for the Gemini 3 Hackathon during the contest period.  
Any prior cybersecurity experience was used only as domain knowledge, not reused application code or pre-existing applications.

## Demo
A short demo video showing Gemini 3 selected in Google AI Studio and generating outputs live is included in the Devpost submission.
